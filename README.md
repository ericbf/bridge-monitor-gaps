# Bridge Monitor Gaps

This is a simple app to assist when you have multiple displays on a mac aligned in such a way as they don’t connect to each other.

Let’s say you have three displays where there is a gap between two displays in the display settings. Normally, your mouse would get stuck on that gap when trying to go between displays. This app allows you to move your mouse freely across that gap. It does that by watching your mouse position and teleporting the mouse to the other dispaly if you hit the display edge.
